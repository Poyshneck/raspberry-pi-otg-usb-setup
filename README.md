# Date: 2025-05-06 (YYYY-MM-DD)
# Description: This script configures the Raspberry Pi for OTG USB mode
# Changelog:
# - Comment out 'otg_mode=1' if present and uncommented to avoid conflicts. (Reason: Prevent conflict with dwc2 overlay.)
# - Added check to prevent overwriting existing /piusb.bin image file. (Reason: Avoid data loss.)
# - Added 'status=progress' to dd command for progress visibility. (Reason: Provide real-time operation feedback.)
# - Added error handling for losetup failure. (Reason: Avoid silent failures if loop device can't be created.)
# - Ensured exfatprogs installed before formatting. (Reason: mkfs.exfat not always pre-installed.)
# - Fallback to pip3 install for dropbox module if not available via apt. (Reason: Compatibility with newer OS versions.)
# - Added checks for existence of service files with feedback if missing. (Reason: Prevent silent failures during service setup.)
